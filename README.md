# Natours
A site I used to learn Sass and some advanced CSS techniques.

# Design Credit
The design of this page comes from Jonas Schmedtmann and his Advanced CSS and Sass course on Udemy.

# Purpose of this project
I already had an intermediate understanding of CSS, but wanted to learn more about transitions and properties that are on the edge of browser acceptance.  As a result, this page isn't fully functioning on all browsers.  It works best on Firefox and second best on Chrome.  As always, it mostly sucks on Edge.  This page has some crazy CSS implementations I'd never do on a production site like the header titles that skew and grow on hover or picture frames that highlight a photo, but the techniques that created them were very useful.

## What this project is NOT

- This project isn't meant to display full cross-browser functionality, though I will be working on that moving forward with graceful degradation.  
- Also this project isn't currently responsive.  That will be added at a future time.
- A display of my mad copywriting skills.  This is no way a reflection of how I would write copy.  It's Lorem for a reason.
- Finally, yes, I know many of the cool things this page does should probably be done with JS and not CSS.  That wasn't the point of this project.  I simply wanted to learn how to use these features to grow my CSS and Sass skills.  In a production setting many of the interactive features like the hamburger menu, popup, and card flip would be done with JavaScript/jQuery.  

# What I learned from this project

- CSS transition and transform
- Sass variables, nesting, and mixins
- NPM live-server
- NPM Sass Compiler
- [7-1 Pattern Architecture] (https://www.sitepoint.com/architecture-sass-project/)
- [Block, Element, Modifier Methodology] (http://getbem.com/introduction/)
- You can do a heck of a lot with box shadows

# Future project goals

- Make the page responsive
- Introduce graceful degradation to offset CSS features not supported in all current browsers (Edge)
- Add a CSS popup that offers more product info on click

## Final thoughts

This has been a super fun project to work on.  If you are looking to grow your CSS skills and get better with a pre-processor like Sass, I highly recommend Jonas' course on Udemy.
